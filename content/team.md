    Alex Ganose is a Lecturer and EPSRC Fellow in the Department of Chemistry at Imperial College London.

    <hr style="height:20px; visibility:hidden;" />

    His research uses computational materials chemistry, machine learning,
    and data science to design new materials for pressing  problems,
    including renewable energy generation (photovoltaics & thermoelectrics) and
    energy storage.

    Alex was awarded his EngD in chemistry from University College London in 2018.
    After a Postdoctoral position at
    Berkeley Lab, California he joined Imperial as an EPSRC Fellow in 2021.
    In 2022, he was appointed as a Lecturer in the Department of Chemistry.
    He is a co-investigator at the [Materials Project](http://materialsproject.org).

## PhD Students

<span class="team"><img src="../team_ruiqi_wu.jpg"></span>
:   ## Ruiqi Wu

    Project: *Designing novel photovoltaics through machine learning*

    <hr style="height:20px; visibility:hidden;" />

    Ruiqi grew up in China, from a small city where Tofu is believed to originate from.
    She obtained undergraduate degrees in Materials Engineering at both the University
    of British Columbia (Canada) and Chongqing University (China) where she investigated metal
    processing, batteries and transistors. After graduating with a distinction in
    Advanced Materials Science from UCL, Ruiqi joined the group in November 2022 as
    the first PhD student, focusing on designing earth-abundant photovoltaics.
    When sheâ€™s not studying, Ruiqi enjoys cooking, manga and fossil hunting.
