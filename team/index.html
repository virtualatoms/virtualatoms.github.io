<p>Alex Ganose is a Lecturer and EPSRC Fellow in the Department of Chemistry at Imperial College London.</p>
<hr style="height:20px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p>His research uses computational materials chemistry, machine learning,
and data science to design new materials for pressing  problems,
including renewable energy generation (photovoltaics &amp; thermoelectrics) and
energy storage.</p>
<hr style="height:20px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p>Alex was awarded his EngD in chemistry from University College London in 2018.
After a Postdoctoral position at
Berkeley Lab, California he joined Imperial as an EPSRC Fellow in 2021.
In 2022, he was appointed as a Lecturer in the Department of Chemistry.
He is a co-investigator at the <a href="http://materialsproject.org">Materials Project</a>.</p>

<hr style="height:20px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p>Ruiqi grew up in China, from a small city where Tofu is believed to originate from.
She obtained undergraduate degrees in Materials Engineering at both the University
of British Columbia (Canada) and Chongqing University (China) where she investigated metal
processing, batteries and transistors. After graduating with a distinction in
Advanced Materials Science from UCL, Ruiqi joined the group in November 2022 as
the first PhD student, focusing on designing earth-abundant photovoltaics.
When she’s not studying, Ruiqi enjoys cooking, manga and fossil hunting.</p>

<p>Leo is a second year PhD student in the Virtual Atoms Group. He joined the group in 2022 as a Masters
student as part of his undergraduate degree, and continued as a PhD student in 2023. Since then, he
has been applying machine learning to problems in chemistry and materials. He is currently working on
generative models for crystalline materials. Leo is an amateur classical pianist, Magic the Gathering
player, and an enthusiast for PC games.</p>

Project: <em>Finite-temperature materials discovery</em>
<hr style="height:10px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p>Shirui Wang graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry from the University of
Birmingham in July 2022. He then completed a Master of Research (MRes) in Nanomaterials at
Imperial College with distinction. Shirui joined the group in December 2022 as a master student,
working on a project titled Computational Insights into Emerging Chalcogenide Perovskite Photovoltaics.
Following the completion of his master, he continued with the group as a PhD student, now focusing on
replacing heavy DFT calculations with machine learning techniques.</p>

Project: <em>Halide solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries</em>
<hr style="height:10px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p>Viktor is a President’s PhD Scholar in the Department of Chemistry at Imperial College London.</p>
<hr style="height:20px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p>Viktor is from Iceland and graduated with a BSc in Chemistry with a focus on computational techniques
from the University of Iceland. His BSc project looked at the computationally aided design of ammonia
NRR catalysts with Prof. Egill Skúlason in collaboration with Atmonia. After the BSc degree he spent one
year in the United States at the University of California Santa Barbara attending the UCSB Extension program.
In 2022, he joined the STEM Group at the University of Oxford supervised by P. D. Nellist, R. J. Nicholls, and
P. G. Bruce. At Oxford he explored the redox mechanism of disordered rocksalt Li-ion cathode materials using
electron microscopy and computational modelling. Viktor joined the Virtual Atoms Lab group in November 2023.
In his spare time, Viktor enjoys reading, listening to music, and brewing coffee as well as playing Badminton.</p>
